You need PHP Simple HTML Dom parser  http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/ to be installed. Feel free to fork and use and adjust to your own needs. 

Or, if you're happy with just the RSS read this for usage and how this came about.

[Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/) the musicservice I love to hate. Last year they had a complete redesign of the site and took down a lot of functionality. Things happen but I wasn't too pleased. The site looked better, but where was the functionality? "Not to worry" they said. "All will be back".
After a year of waiting I gave up hope, just as many other people gave up hope. Everything what made last.fm great to use, and added value was gone. Still is gone and it will probably never return. So...

I started to scrape the bloody site and created (in a couple of hours) what they can't/won't in a year. RSS-Feed of your recent tracks.

since it was so simple, how about add a little love? Just add '<em>&loved</em>' to your feed an you get your last loved tracks.
